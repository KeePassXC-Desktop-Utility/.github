## üñå Overview  

**KeePassXC Password Manager** is a cross-platform open-source tool designed for users who value privacy, security, and complete local control over their credentials.  
It stores passwords and sensitive data in an encrypted database using the AES-256 algorithm, ensuring that only you can access your information.  

The intuitive interface allows users to organize accounts, generate strong passwords, and autofill login forms in browsers like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.  
KeePassXC integrates with browser extensions to provide seamless credential management without exposing data online.  

Unlike cloud-based password managers, **KeePassXC** keeps all data on your local device or private network, eliminating the risk of remote breaches.  
It‚Äôs ideal for IT professionals, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and everyday users who want a transparent, privacy-first password manager.  

Frequent updates, cross-device compatibility, and community-driven development make **KeePassXC** one of the most trusted password tools for Windows and Linux.
